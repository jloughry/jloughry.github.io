This is a personal blog hosted on GitHub. It resides in a public repository. I use it for
experimentation. For security reasons, the public-facing portion is limited to static HTML
only; there are no exploitable interfaces for an attacker to try.

Scheme source code is notional only at this point, prototype data for the CSS implementation
I plan to do next.

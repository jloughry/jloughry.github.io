This is a personal blog hosted on GitHub. It resides in a public repository. I use it for
experimentation. For security reasons, the public-facing portion is limited to static HTML
only; there are no exploitable interfaces for an attacker to try.

Scheme source code is notional only at this point, being prototype data for the CSS
implementation of syntax highlighting that I plan to do next.

The favicon is composed of a lowercase italic (sometimes bold italic) Palatino Linotype
letter *"f"* in 24 points between a pair of un-italicised parentheses; the character spacing
of all three characters is extended by 4 or 5 points. The intent is for the outer rim of
the parentheses to match as nearly as possible a perfect circle, and for the serifs on the
'f' to match the angle of the horns of the parentheses so it flows together like a &#9775;
symbol.

            <tr><td><a href="./graphics/venn_diagrams_muted.png"><img

            <tr><td style="text-align: center"><em>Cross domain systems are
                unique because they always go into an adversarial
                environment with mutually distrustful data
                owners.</em></td></tr></table>

        <p>An idea I've been playing around with for a while involves
        characterising every allowable permutation of cross
        domain system (CDS) in collateral, SCI, and international
        accreditations. The approach has been peer reviewed and
        published (13th IEEE Conference on Technologies for Homeland
        Security, Boston: 2013); the presentation here is based on a talk I
        gave last year.</p>

        <p>Incident response, analytically, looks a lot like an
        international coalition; in the case of major incident response,
        you have large organisations trying to negotiate their jurisdiction
        and announce their capabilities, in a short amount of time, to
        those who need it.</p>
        
        <p>(The moral of the story is: don't overlook potential applications
        of CDS in ephemeral situations&mdash;but to do that, we'll need
        faster and less expensive A&amp;A.)</p>

        <p>Cross domain systems exist to interconnect...anything. They will
        talk any protocol needed to do it&mdash;but they focus on protecting
        systems from each other. That's what distinguishes them from
        firewalls; a firewall is usually thought of as protecting an
        organisation's resources from outside threats, but a cross domain
        system protects the rest of the world from the organisation as
        well.</p>
        
        <p>(If that reminds you of protecting financial markets from
        rogue traders with access to inside information, it should.)</p>

        <p>Certification and accreditation testing are my interest.
        (&ldquo;Assessment and Authorisation&rdquo; is the preferred
        terminology, but I'm using the older &ldquo;C&amp;A&rdquo;
        nomenclature here.) Certification testing is done on a particular
        configuration of hardware and software called the &lsquo;evaluated
        configuration&rsquo;. Usually, an evaluated configuration is
        not a realistic field setup, because certification testers
        usually want <i>all</i> the features turned on so they can test
        them. Penetration testing is often done at this phase; penetration
        testers similarly demand root access and source code. Much like
        covert channel analysis, penetration testing has no natural end
        state; pen testers, given enough time, nearly always can come up
        with yet another layer of attack. Part of my research aims to
        enable the cross domain system developer some measure of control
        over the duration of certification testing, which otherwise
        <i>will</i> stretch out to consume all of the available time and
        money and resources.</p>

        <p>The second type of testing done on cross domain systems happens
        at the end of installation, but before approval-to-operate. It's
        called accreditation, and it's done&mdash;every time&mdash;on a particular
        installation, in a particular place, with a particular
        configuration and particular users. Certification may be done once, or
        at most once a year; accreditation is done every time you sell one.</p>

        <p><em>It pays to get good at accreditation, because you'll be
        doing it lots.</em></p>

        <p>Accreditation testing is interesting because for cross domain
        systems it always involves more than one
        accreditor&mdash;accreditors represent the interests of data
        owners&mdash;who mistrust one another. Since there are multiple
        accreditors, and since each one thinks his or her data is the
        most important, this leads directly to multiple rounds of
        testing. Everyone knows what the best attacks are; there's only
        so many variations on how you can test that. If every one of those
        accreditors, for due diligence, performs the same tests over and
        over again, we don't learn anything new. That's the problem I
        set out to solve.

        <table style="width: 40%; float: right; margin: 5px">
            <tr><td><a
                href="./graphics/venn_diagrams_for_slides_1.png"><img
                src="./graphics/venn_diagrams_for_slides_1_400w.png"
                alt="accreditor's view of a computer system"></a></td></tr>
            <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
            <tr><td style="text-align: center"><em>The larger circle
                contains known threats that would be desirable to mitigate
                (surrounded, of course, by a larger universe of unknown
                threats); the smaller circle contains only those threats it
                is deemed possible to mitigate at this
                time.</em></td></tr></table>

        <p>In my model, the following assumptions are required:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Accreditors have appropriate security clearances for their
            jobs.</li>
            <li>Every cross domain system has a high side and a low
            side.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>It's a minimal set of assumptions, not too unrealistic and
        not far off from the real world. First, we assume that
        all accreditors have just the right security clearance to do
        their jobs. If they work on Top Secret, they have a Top Secret
        clearance. If they only work on Confidential, then they will
        <em>not</em> have a Secret clearance, or a higher one. Everybody's
        cleared only to the level they need to be.</p>

        <p>The second assumption is that there's a high side and a low
        side. That's often a matter of opinion, especially in international
        accreditations, but it simplifies the analysis. Besides, you
        can always partition any cross domain system with more than two
        inputs or outputs pairwise into a series of one-in-one-out cross
        domain systems. We used to have to do this all the time with
        pie-in-the-sky PL-5 customer requirements that we could compose
        out of one or more PL-4 approved components. PL-5 components are
        expensive; PL-4 components are not. So you can always reduce
        a cross domain problem, ultimately, to a high side and a low
        side.</p>

        <p>Consider an accreditor's view of the system (above and to the
        right). The larger circle represents those threats that would be
        <em>desirable</em> to mitigate. The smaller circle contains the
        subset of threats that it's <em>feasible</em> to
        mitigate&mdash;everything has a cost, and not every security
        control the accreditor wants, the accreditor is likely to get. The
        area between the circles is the residual risk.</p>

        <p>In the figure to the right, we have a multi-level system. As
        soon as you have a multi-level system, you may have two
        accreditors, and in the most general case, shown here, they
        share no information.</p>

        <p><em>To the right, then, is the essence of an SCI (or
        international) accreditation.</em></p>

        <p>Accreditor 1 has a completely
        independent idea of what threats exist (<i>A</i><sub>1</sub>)
        and what risk mitigations are possible (<i>B</i><sub>1</sub>);
        similarly, Accreditor 2 is cognisant of a different set of risks
        (<i>A</i><sub>2</sub>) that would be desirable to mitigate,
        and a smaller set (<i>B</i><sub>2</sub>) of risks that are, from
        Accreditor 2's perspective, possible to mitigate. The sets are
        disjoint because we assume (in the most general case) that
        accreditors read into different compartments are unable or
        unwilling to share information.</p>

        <p>The circles may overlap&mdash;of course they do!&mdash;everyone
        knows what the common attacks are, just as everyone knows what's
        affordable to mitigate. Those are your baseline security controls;
        what we're more interested in here are classified threats and
        classified threat mitigations.</p>

        <table style="width: 40%; float: left; margin: 5px">

        <p>In the figure to the left, the highlighted area <i>R</i> is
        the agreed residual risk that both accreditors share. These
        particular accreditors don't share much&mdash;the question of
        which is the &lsquo;high side&rsquo; and which is the &lsquo;low
        side&rsquo; is often a matter of opinion, especially in the
        SCI world&mdash;but they agree on a few known threats. Both
        accreditors concur that some risks, highlighted here in cyan, are
        not protect-able against, and are going to remain a threat to the
        system in production, as residual risk. It's outside the smaller
        areas that both know they can mitigate.</p>
        
        <p>In the general sense, <i>A</i><sub>1</sub> and
        <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> probably overlap to a greater or lesser
        degree&mdash;since everyone knows about the major problems:
        bot-nets and Heartbleed and script kiddies and what-not&mdash;but
        it's hard to draw Venn diagrams in three dimensions.</p>

        <p><em>This is the ideal SCI situation, reachable sometimes in
        practice. Public information, after all, need not be protected from
        disclosure.</em></p>

        <table style="width: 40%; float: right; margin: 5px">

                with risk of information leakage</em></td></tr></table>

        <p>But here's where things begin to get interesting. As
        the two accreditors perform their security testing, both of
        them <em>learn</em> more about the system under test. The small
        area <i>C</i>, shown in green, is <b>safe</b> because Accreditor
        1 has mitigated it with security controls. The second accreditor
        can legally be made aware (without loss of generality) that that
        the first has mitigated that portion of the threat, so Accreditor 2
        doesn't have to worry about area <i>C</i> any more.</p>

        <p>But there's a new risk of information leakage from high to low.
        Region <i>L</i>, shown in dark blue, represents classified
        information&mdash;that is, the existence of a threat that
        is classified higher than the clearance of the low-side
        accreditor. (Remember the first assumption: that accreditors are
        cleared only as high as they need to be, in adherence to the letter
        <em>and</em> the spirit of the law.)</p>

        <p>The high side accreditor, on the right side of the figure,
        doesn't want to admit to the low side accreditor that these threats
        <em>still</em> can't properly be mitigated even with classified
        security controls. But it's still safe, because the high side
        accreditor isn't <em>compelled</em> to say anything, and it's safer
        to keep his or her mouth shut. There's a threat of information
        leakage, but no actual information leakage, and the existence of
        the classified threat (for which no mitigation is feasible on the
        high side) remains protected.</p>

        <table style="width: 40%; float: left; margin: 5px">

        <p>The red zone emerges with the occurrence of <em>forced
        communication</em>. The high side accreditor&mdash;and remember,
        this is an international (or SCI) cross domain system, so
        the question of which side is the high side is a matter of
        opinion&mdash;the high side accreditor knows something dangerous:
        he or she knows that some of the low-side security controls <b>do
        not work</b>. But that information is classified. The high side
        accreditor, though, personally accepts the risk for the correct
        operation of the <em>entire</em> cross domain system&mdash;not just
        part of it&mdash;if he or she accredits it.</p>
        
        <p>Should the high-side accreditor refuse to accredit? To do
        otherwise would shoulder a known risk (that the true residual risk
        of the system is higher than generally believed); in that case
        the high-side accreditor runs the risk of going to jail. Unable
        to say precisely why he won't accredit&mdash;because that is a
        violation of his oath to protect classified information&mdash;if
        he refuses to accredit, <em>even if he won't say why</em>, the
        refusal in itself leaks the existence of a classified threat with
        no known mitigation.</p>
        
        <p>Checkmate. (Note that the previous risk of leakage of the
        existence of classified threat mitigations, in dark blue, still
        exists, but that's a different kind of risk.)</p>

        <p>Here, there is not only a risk of information leakage but
        personal risk to Accreditor 2; the red region
        <i>H</i>&mdash;remember, this is still an SCI
        accreditation&mdash;is believed by the first accreditor to
        be adequately mitigated by security controls, but the second
        accreditor either doesn't know about the first's mitigation or
        doesn't believe it'll work.</p>

        or international intelligence sharing agreements&mdash;the area of
        agreement over the true level of residual risk of the cross domain
        system grows. The risk of classified information leakage and
        personal risk to one or more accreditors diminishes as the
        situation approaches a pure collateral configuration.</p>

        <p>In the degenerate situation, below, there is complete agreement
        on residual risk (<i>A</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> =
        <i>R</i>), complete consensus on safety (<i>B</i><sub>1</sub> =
        <i>B</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>C</i>), and both accreditors know all.
        It's not very interesting.</p>

        <p>That was the abstract situation&mdash;one that models
        international or SCI accreditations well, in situations where there
        is no formal channel of communication between accreditors on
        different sides. That's not an uncommon problem for cross domain
        system developers to find themselves in; does the U.S. government
        &lsquo;outrank&rsquo; Her Majesty&apos;s own need for information
        protection? The U.K. government doesn't think so.</p>

        <p>So let's look at a simpler case, one occurring entirely inside
        the U.S. military or U.S. government itself (although not inside
        the intelligence community&mdash;they use SCI). Here we're
        connecting a Top Secret network to a Secret one. We can assume
        from this point on that the high side accreditor knows everything
        the low side accreditor knows. But the high side accreditor knows
        more&mdash;Top Secret things. Regardless, it ought to be a solvable
        problem, because there is no inaccessible knowledge. There is
        information asymmetry, but no hidden information this time. (See
        the figure below and to the right.)</p>

        <table style="width: 40%; float: right; margin: 5px">

        <p>Oh, no&mdash;it happened again! As security testing progresses,
        it can occur that the high side accreditor becomes aware of
        security controls that the low side accreditor has put in place, in
        good faith, but that <b>do not work</b>. I call this &lsquo;guilty
        knowledge&rsquo; (see below). The other areas in the Venn diagrams,
        the dark grey and black areas, are classified threats and
        classified threat mitigations that the high side accreditor can't
        talk about, because they're legitimately classified. But the area
        in red represents <em>forced communication</em>.</p>

        <p>There is a paradox in the Bell&ndash;LaPadula security model. If
        you clear your accreditors only to the level they need to be
        cleared to do their jobs, then occasionally some desirable
        information flows are inhibited and some undesirable information
        flows are forced. If, on the other hand, you clear a pool of
        accreditors to Top Secret, and you use them on jobs that don't
        require a Top Secret clearance all the time, then the information
        asymmetry disappears and the information leakage doesn't happen. It
        is a paradox, that loosening the security rules actually improves
        security.</p>

        <p>In some reachable cases, that is, in <em>real</em> installation
        problems that cross domain system developers and installers
        sometimes encounter in the field, desirable information flows
        may be inhibited, or undesirable information flows may be
        forced. These represent information asymmetry in the
        accreditor-to-accreditor relationship and are <i>logical
        consequences</i> of the hierarchical security relationship. We
        can't prevent them&mdash;the possibility is inherent, as we have
        seen, in SCI, international, and collateral accreditations.</p>
        
        <p>But can we detect and avoid the trap? The goal of the <b>Policy
        Interaction</b> layer in our notional future cross domain solution
        is to find and highlight the problematic configurations during
        testing and development in order to streamline the process and
        reduce the cost (in both time and dollars) of CDS deployments.</p>

		<p>I have intermittent network connectivity. What I wish for

		into working well enough, without hanging, until real network
		service returned, at which point it would silently catch up. Web
		pages would not load, obviously, but I could enter new Google
		calendar events, send emails, and commit changes to GitHub without
		having to wait and remember to do it later. As it is, I write notes
		to myself. I think the network stack could do something similar.</p>

		<p>Clearly, new apps can be written to have the same behaviour, but
		this would enable old apps, without rewriting, to have the new

		<p>The second example uses the auto-indent <span class="html-tag">div</span>
		method. Note that no <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> character entities are needed
		in the source:</p>

		<div id="syntax-highlighting-test-2">
			<div class="code">
				<div class="syntax-multiline-block">
					<span class="punct">(</span><span class="keyword">define</span>
					<span class="identifier">length</span>
					<div class="syntax-multiline-block">
						<span class="punct">(</span><span class="keyword">lambda</span>
						<span class="punct">(</span><span class="identifier">l</span><span
							class="punct">)</span>
						<div class="syntax-multiline-block">
							<span class="punct">(</span><span class="keyword">if</span>
							<span class="punct">(</span><span class="function">null?</span>
							<span class="identifier">l</span><span class="punct">)</span>
							<div class="syntax-comment">; this is a comment</div>
							<br/>
							<span class="constant">0</span>
							<br/>
							<div class="syntax-same-line-block">
								<span class="punct">(</span><span class="function">+</span>
								<span class="constant">1</span>
								<div class="syntax-same-line-block">
									<span class="punct">(</span><span class="function">length</span>
									<div class="syntax-same-line-block">
										<span class="punct">(</span><span
											class="function">cdr</span>
										<span class="identifier">l</span><span
											class="punct">))))))</span>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

		</div>

		<p>It's a little disappointing that closing parentheses cannot be put
		inside the <span class="html-tag">div</span> blocks if we want to stack
		all the parens at the end, but if stacking the closing parens is not
		desired, then putting the closing paren <em>after</em> the closing <span
		class="html-tag">/div</span> keeps the indentation levels of the closing
		parens where they ought to be (<em>i.e.</em>, don't put closing parens
		inside the closing <span class="html-tag">/div</span>.)</p>

		<p>The third example was auto-generated by a syntax-highlighting parser:</p>

		<div id="syntax-highlighting-test-3">
			<div class="code">
				<div class="syntax-comment">; coming soon</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>(Note that a tab is automatically inserted before in-line comments;
		I may have to fix that.)</p>

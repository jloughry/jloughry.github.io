This is an experimental site I use for learning. I'm a grad student in the
department of computer science at the University of Oxford; my thesis is
about how computer security testers co-operate with other security testers
in different organisations (or countries, or security classification
levels) whom they can't talk to directly for fear of violating security
rules. Cross domain systems are like that. For information on why this file
exists, see http://humanstxt.org/ and if you want to find me, try email to
